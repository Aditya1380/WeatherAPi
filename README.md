<h1>Weather App using MERN Stack:</h1>

<p>The Weather App is a web application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It provides users with real-time weather information for various locations around the world. The application fetches weather data from a free-to-use weather API, allowing users to search for weather forecasts by city name.</p>

<h1>Key Features:</h1>

1.Real-Time Weather Data: The app fetches real-time weather data using a free weather API, ensuring that users get accurate and up-to-date weather information for their desired locations.

2.Search by City: Users can search for weather forecasts by entering the name of a city. The app retrieves the weather data for the specified city and displays it to the user.

3.Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

4.MERN Stack Architecture: The app is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB for database management, Express.js for server-side development, React.js for the client-side user interface, and Node.js for server-side JavaScript runtime.

<h1>Technologies Used:</h1>

<ul>
    <li>MongoDB: MongoDB is used as the database to store user data and city information.</li>
    <li>Express.js: Express.js is used to build the server-side API endpoints and handle HTTP requests and responses.</li>
    <li>React.js: React.js is used to develop the client-side user interface, allowing for a dynamic and interactive user experience.</li>
    <li>Node.js: Node.js is used as the server-side JavaScript runtime environment to run the server-side code and interact with the database.</li>
    <li>Axios: Axios is used to make HTTP requests from the client-side React components to fetch weather data from the weather API.</li>
</ul>
